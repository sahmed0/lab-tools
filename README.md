# 🧬 Molecular Biology Toolkit

A lightweight, web-based utility designed for biology lab workers to perform common molecular biology calculations quickly and accurately.

### Online
Visit [Molecular Biology Toolkit](https://sahmed0.github.io/lab-tools/) to use the toolkit.

### Local
I have limited everything to one file so it's easy to install and use for non-technical users.
1. Download the index.html file
2. Open in your browser to use it.
3. Open in an IDE to edit it.

## Features

The toolkit provides 8 essential calculation modules:

1.  **Mass-Molarity**: Calculate the mass required for a specific molar concentration and volume.
2.  **General Dilution**: Quickly compute $C_1V_1 = C_2V_2$ dilutions.
3.  **WB Loading (BCA)**: Equalize protein mass for Western Blot loading.
4.  **Antibody Dilution**: Calculate antibody and buffer volumes for specific ratios.
5.  **Gel Recipe**: Generate precise recipes for SDS-PAGE casting (Acrylamide, Tris, SDS, etc.).
6.  **Nucleotide Quantification**: Determine DNA/RNA concentration from $A_{260}$ absorbance.
7.  **Purity Check**: Analyze $260/280$ and $260/230$ ratios for contamination.
8.  **Mass to Moles**: Convert DNA mass (ng) to moles (pmol) based on base pair length.

## Design & Philosophy

-   **Simple UI**: High-contrast, monochrome-adjacent theme with large buttons and legible fonts, all in one page to minimise context-switching.
-   **Mobile First**: Fully responsive design optimised for iPads and smartphones, featuring large touch targets and readable typography.
-   **Lighthearted Tone**: Includes a touch of sarcasm to keep your long hours in the hood interesting.

## Tech Stack

-   **HTML5/CSS3**: Pure vanilla code for maximum performance.
-   **JavaScript**: ES6+ logic for instant calculations.
-   **MathJax**: High-quality LaTeX-style mathematical rendering.
